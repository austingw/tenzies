# About # 

This project was my first attempt at a functional React app that involves more complex use of state, props, and hooks. It was challenging at first to wrap my head around passing props to various components and keeping track of game logic via state, but through continuous effort functional React quickly became my preferred way to create an app from scratch. 

# Features #

- Player choice and win state kept track of via state
- Functional turn and round counters displayed right at the top of the game screen
- Simple, clean design to focus on the gameplay and clearly illustrate player choice
- Confetti appears upon meeting win conditions!

# Built with #

- React
- CSS
- Vite
